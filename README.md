# My Python Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of Python projects! This repository contains a collection of scripts and applications I've built, including my solutions for the **freeCodeCamp "Scientific Computing with Python"** certification. Many of these projects go beyond the original requirements, featuring enhanced functionalities and user-friendly command-line interfaces.

## üöÄ About This Collection

This repository is a showcase of my skills in Python, demonstrating my ability to solve problems, work with data, and build interactive applications. Each project is contained within its own directory and includes a description of its purpose and features.

## üìÇ Projects

Here is a list of the projects included in this repository:

1.  [**Ciphers**](./01_Ciphers/): An application to encrypt and decrypt messages using both Caesar and Vigenere ciphers, complete with an interactive command-line interface.
2.  [**Luhn Algorithm Validator**](./02_Luhn_Algorithm/): A script to validate credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm.
3.  [**Expense Tracker**](./03_Expense_Tracker/): A CLI tool to add, track, categorize, and view expenses. Features include calculating total expenses and exporting data to a `.csv` file.
4.  [**Case Converter**](./04_Case_Converter/): A handy utility script to convert strings from `PascalCase` or `camelCase` to `snake_case`.
5.  [**Bisection Method for Square Root**](./05_Bisection_Method/): An implementation of the bisection method, a numerical algorithm, to find the approximate square root of a number.
6.  [**Arithmetic Formatter**](./06_Arithmetic_Formatter/): My solution to the freeCodeCamp project. The extended version handles additional operators (`*`, `/`, `%`) and bitwise operations.
