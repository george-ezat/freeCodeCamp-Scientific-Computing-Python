# Python Projects Portfolio

This repository serves as a professional portfolio of Python applications and scripts. It includes solutions developed for the **freeCodeCamp "Scientific Computing with Python"** certification, many of which have been extended with additional features and interactive command-line interfaces. The projects within demonstrate a strong foundation in Python, algorithmic problem-solving, and software development best practices.

## 🚀 About This Collection

This repository is a showcase of my skills in Python, demonstrating my ability to solve problems, work with data, and build interactive applications. Each project is contained within its own directory and includes a description of its purpose and features.

## 📂 Projects

This repository features a variety of command-line applications and scripts, each built to solve a specific problem while demonstrating different aspects of Python development.

| \# | Project | Description | Key Skills & Concepts |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [**Ciphers**](./01_Ciphers/) | A full-featured CLI application for encrypting and decrypting messages using both Caesar and Vigenere ciphers. The user-friendly interface allows for easy selection of the cipher, operation, and key/offset. | `os`, `termcolor`, `string` module, modular arithmetic, user input validation, function decomposition, menu-driven CLI design. |
| 2 | [**Luhn Algorithm**](./02_Luhn_Algorithm/) | A script that implements the Luhn checksum algorithm to validate identification numbers, most commonly used for credit cards. It processes the number as a string and performs the necessary mathematical checks. | Algorithmic implementation, list slicing & manipulation, functional programming (`map`), list comprehensions, string methods (`.strip()`, `.translate()`). |
| 3 | [**Expense Tracker**](./03_Expense_Tracker/) | An interactive CLI tool for personal finance management. Users can add expenses, view aggregated totals, see expenses grouped by category, list all entries, and export the complete history to a timestamped CSV file. | File I/O (CSV writing), `datetime`, `os`, `termcolor`, `collections.defaultdict`, functional programming (`map`, `filter`), robust error handling. |
| 4 | [**Case Converter**](./04_Case_Converter/) | A utility function that cleanly converts a string from `PascalCase` or `camelCase` into the Python-standard `snake_case`, a common requirement for maintaining code style. | List comprehensions, conditional logic within comprehensions, advanced string methods (`.isupper()`, `.lower()`, `.join()`, `.strip()`). |
| 5 | [**Bisection Method**](./05_Bisection_Method/) | A script that implements the bisection search algorithm, a root-finding numerical method, to calculate the approximate square root of a number within a specified tolerance. | Numerical methods, algorithm implementation, loop control, handling float precision. |
| 6 | [**Arithmetic Formatter**](./06_Arithmetic_Formatter/) | An advanced function that takes a list of arithmetic problems and formats them vertically and side-by-side. The extended version is enhanced to support `*`, `/`, `%`, and bitwise operators (`&`, `\|`, `^`). | Advanced string formatting (`.rjust()`), function decomposition, robust error handling, list manipulation, operator logic. |
| 7 | [**Password Generator**](./07_Password_Generator/) | A secure password generator CLI that creates strong, randomized passwords. It allows users to customize constraints like length, inclusion of specific character types, and whether to allow duplicate characters. | `secrets` module (for cryptographic strength), `random.shuffle`, `string` constants, set operations, advanced user input validation, `termcolor`. |
| 8 | [**Shortest Path**](./08_shortest_path/) | An implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph. It calculates distances and reconstructs the optimal path from a given start node. | Graph Theory, Dijkstra's Algorithm, Dictionaries, `float('inf')`, Pathfinding. |
| 9 | [**Tower of Hanoi**](./09_tower_of_hanoi/) | Solves the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle using both recursive and iterative approaches. This demonstrates two different paradigms for solving the same complex problem. | Recursion, Iteration, Algorithmic Thinking, Problem Solving. |
| 10 | [**Merge Sort**](./10_merge_sort/) | An implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm, a highly efficient, recursive sorting algorithm that uses the "divide and conquer" strategy. | Sorting Algorithms, Recursion, Divide and Conquer, List Slicing. |
| 11 | [**Time Calculator**](./11_Time_Calculator/) | A function that accurately calculates a future time and day of the week by adding a duration to a starting time, handling all AM/PM and multi-day transitions without using any date/time libraries. | Time Calculation, Modulo Arithmetic, String Parsing, Logical Operations. |
| 12 | [**Sudoku Solver**](./12_Sudoku_Solver/) | An object-oriented Sudoku solver that uses a backtracking algorithm to solve any valid 9x9 puzzle. The class-based structure encapsulates the board and solving logic. | OOP, Backtracking Algorithm, Recursion, 2D Lists (Matrices). |
| 13 | [**Binary Search Tree**](./13_Binary_Search_Tree/) | A complete implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure. The extended version includes multiple traversal methods (in-order, pre-order, post-order) and tree information properties (`size`, `height`). | Data Structures, OOP, Recursion, Tree Traversal. |
| 14 | [**Budget App**](./14_Budget_App/) | An object-oriented application for managing budget categories. It tracks deposits, withdrawals, and transfers, and generates a visual spending chart to compare expenses across categories. | OOP, Class Methods, String Formatting & Manipulation, Data Aggregation. |
| 15 | [**Vector Space**](./15_Vector_Space/) | An object-oriented implementation of 2D and 3D vectors. This project uses inheritance and extensively overloads Python's special "dunder" methods to enable natural mathematical operations (+, *, <, ==, etc.). | Advanced OOP, Inheritance, Dunder Methods, Operator Overloading, Vector Math. |
| 16 | [**Equation Solver**](./16_Equation_Solver/) | An object-oriented equation solver built with an Abstract Base Class (ABC) framework. It solves and analyzes linear and quadratic equations, demonstrating polymorphism and robust error handling. | OOP, Abstract Base Classes (ABC), Polymorphism, Dunder Methods, match Statement, re module. |
| 17 | [**Polygon Area Calculator**](./17_Polygon_Area_Calculator/) | An object-oriented project that uses a Square class inheriting from a Rectangle class to model geometric shapes and calculate their properties like area, perimeter, and diagonal. | OOP, Inheritance, Class Methods, Dunder Methods (`__repr__`). |
